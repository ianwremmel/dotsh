## Install

You can get dotsh in one of several ways:

-   The canonical, but perhaps least useful, method is to install it from npm.

    ```bash
    npm install @ianwremmel/dotsh
    ```

-   Download the latest
    [release](https://github.com/ianwremmel/dotsh/releases/latest) from GitHub.

-   Run the one-line bootstrapper:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL -o- \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianwremmel/dotsh/master/curl.sh | bash
    ```

    > This is the most convenient method, of course, and while a common pattern
    > amongst similar projects, has a number of security concerns you should
    > consider. Piping arguably untrusted code to bash might be considered
    > risky.

## Usage

### `dotsh apply`

Applies (or reapplies) your config to a machine. You should run `dotsh scaffold`
somewhere first and customize your config.

### `dotsh scaffold`

Creates a config repo without making any alterations to the machine.

## Customizing The Scaffold

This repo contains a basic set of dotfiles and inspired by (though heavily
modified) [Mathias Bynens dotfiles](). After running the `scaffold` command,
you'll have a repo containing a config that you can customize to your heart's
content.

### Layout

-   .profile, .bash_profile, .bashrc
-   .dotsh.d
-   .dotsh.d/bash_profile.d
-   Brewfile

### Things you can't change

-   You're getting homebrew
-   .profile, .bash_profile, .bashrc, .dotsh.d/bash_profile

### Alterations to how you're used to doing things

-   `"${BREW_HOME:-$(brew --prefix)}"`
-   git aliases (fixup, autosquash, pfl)
-   git rerere
-   vim no arrow keys

## Opinions

Though the whole point of this project is to separate control from
configuration, several opinions (for lack of a better term) applied herein
cannot be avoided. Some of these are because they are necessary for dotsh to
work and some are because we don't see a reason why you wouldn't just want to do
some of these things and giving you the choice is more effort than it's worth.

You're going to get the following packages:

-   bash@4
-   bash-completion
-   coreutils
-   findutils
-   gnu-sed
-   vim
-   grep
-   sreen
-   git
-   git-lfs
-   jq
-   yq
-   python
-   python@2
-   ruby
-   qlmarkdown
-   qlstephen
-   quicklook-json

You're going to be logged into GitHub via `.netrc` and your global git
credentials will be set. We'll attempt to use your GitHub no-reply address if
you have one.

Beyond that, many opinions will be encoded in your home directory dotfiles, but
you should be able to change most of them.
